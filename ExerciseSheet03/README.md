## Exercise 01  |   Histogram equalization 
* Load the image `bookstore_dark.tif` and generate its histogram using your function from the first assignment.
* Generate the cumulative histogram.
* Map each intensity k in the original image onto the closest value s_k *255. 
* Visualize the equalized image image, as well as its histogram and cumulative histogram, to verify your results. 

## Exercise 02  |   Image gradients
* (Handwritten assignment) Fill in the missing values in Table (look in solutions). 
* Load the image `circles.png`. Calculate I_x and I_y. 
* For each pixel, calculate the gradient magnitude and gradient orientation.
* Plot the Results
    - The gradient magnitude can directly be plotted as intensity image. Since the absolute values may be low, scale the displayed intensities appropriately and indicate what the scale is. 
    - Visualize the different orientations. 
    - Visualize the vector field using the function `quiver`.
